I HAVE DONE THE PROJECT USING
  . creating a class which contains private members.
  Encapsulation- making members private and making methods/functions to access public
  Composition-involves including an obj of one class as a member of another class
  Exception Handling


  // we choose composition over inheritance
// defining two classes (Movie and MoviesDatabase) and uses composition to include an object of one class (Movie) as a member of 
//another class (MoviesDatabase). Inheritance involves creating a new class by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class,
// and it is not utilized in the given code.

//Inheritance is a concept where a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class 
//(base class or parent class). If inheritance were used, you would see a relationship like
 //class DerivedClass : public BaseClass, but this is not present in the provided code.
